Hello! Welcome to our new website!

We're still in the early days for setting things up, but we hope soon to set this up to be *the* home of all Ender IO information.
You can expect a new player guide, an A-Z wiki and some technical information for addon, modpack and datapack creators.

If you would like to help us set this up, visit this project on GitHub to get started :)

We'll also be using this as a way of posting more accessible information, similarly to how we have been using Discord for these last few years.
There won't be a blog post for every single release, but we will likely post major release information, Minecraft update news and more here.

That's all I really have to share with everyone at the minute,
Welcome to the new site folks!
