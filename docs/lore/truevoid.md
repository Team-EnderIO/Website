# Rekindled Void

After venturing through strongholds, a new unknown dimension has been found. This dimension seems to be absolutely filled 
void energy, and seems much purer compared to what is found in the overworld. After exploring the main island, a big creator 
has been found to be containing this refined void energy. It is clear if this "Dragon" is the source of the energy, or merely 
an inhabitant, but it seems that it can spread a highly energised form of void energy from its breath. This energy has been 
described as "Rekindled Void" energy, as it seems to purify the energy by burning it.

Many are eagerly trying to find a way to capture this new purified energy source. The hope is to utilise it to advance the 
void based machines to the next stage, by infusing them with this new gaseous for of energy.

Since this creator seems to create the rekindled void gas from the void energy in the atmosphere, the question has been asked 
if it is possible to imitate it. It might be possible by using the dead creatures head, binding it with soularium and filling 
it up with "essence" found in sculk. This could animate the creature enough for it to produce a similar gas containing the 
purified void energy. This procedure is however highly controversial, as animating the dead always carries risks.
