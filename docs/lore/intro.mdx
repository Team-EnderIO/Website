# Themes

During your play of Ender IO, you will run into to many machines and items making use of different `Themes`. These themes 
are meant to give the machines a unique feel, and to group machines with similar functions or crafting steps. In the following 
categories you can find WIP flavour texts written about where these themes come from, and what they are used for. This is 
a first draft, and as such is still subject to many changes. Eventually, this might be incorporated into a guide book in game, 
to give it a bit more flavour and not be a dry list of information.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';

<DocCardList />
