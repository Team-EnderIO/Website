# Souls

The idea of a "soul" that gets left behind when you die has always been considered a superstition. That was until *it* was 
found. Deep in what can only be described as a burning wasteland, *it* can be found around every corner. At first it was 
that it was just normal sand, and that it slowing you down was just due to it being sand. However, that changed after it 
was really looked into. The slowdown dit not come from it being sand, it was not physically stopping you. No instead, it 
felt more like some was pulling on you, trying to drag you down, trying to absorb you. That's when it was realised that 
what this sand actually was: "Soul Sand". This sand contained millions of souls, all desperately grabbing onto whatever walked 
over them to make it join them. Many have tried to research the phenomena, to try and reach out to the souls and communicate 
with them. But it seems that the individual souls have long since disappeared. All that is left is the combined mess of 
souls that is soul sand.

By using metallurgy, it is possible to refine soul sand into a "Soularium" ingot. This ingot still contains parts of the 
souls found in soulsand. With this new ingot as a base, a new group of machines becomes possible, using the power of souls.

Continuing this research, it appears to be possible to use soularium to capture the soul of a mob and use it to "ensoul" a 
machine. These machines have different behaviours based on which mob's soul was used, and thus open a new area of unexplored 
possibilities.
