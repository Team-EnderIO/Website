# The Void

Not much is known about the void, just that it exist. The lower you go, the stronger you can feel it, until 
you reach the bedrock. It has been theorised that long ago, this would have been normal stone, but the exposure to the 
mysterious energy of the void has changed it over time. Even the stone not directly touching the void seems to have been 
changed by its influence, forming deepslate. 

Many have tried to break through the bedrock, to be able to take a glimpse at 
the void and harvest its power. All, however, have failed. At some point, it was pointed out that even though the bedrock 
could not be broken, the power of the void has also infused itself into stone dust found on top of the bedrock. These "Grains 
of Infinity" as they are called cary a fraction of the voids power, even when removed from the ground. This started a new 
age of technology and discovery, all powered by the mysterious power of the void contained in these small grains.
