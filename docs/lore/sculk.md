# Sculk

First it was considered just an aggressive version of mos found deep inside caves, however, this seemed to be an incomplete 
description. Sculk definitely shows plantlike characteristics similar to moss, but it seems the close proximity to the void 
has changed it over time. Furthermore, after care full observation and a deepend undersgtanding of the power of souls, it 
seems like grows by "eating" the soul of a mob. This behaviour is different from soulsand, where the individual souls are 
merged into one. Sculk on the other hand seems to convert the soul into "essence" or "knowledge" and seems to consume that 
instead.

Sculk harvesting is still in the early stages of discovery, but its ability to store and release this "essence" is very 
interesting and is worth further studies.

Due to the rarity of obtaining sculk, there is an effort in creating "artifical" plants using grains of infinty, soularium 
and plant based materials. Initial testing seems promising, as this new plant seems to be able to absorb the essence of 
slain mobs just like sculk.
